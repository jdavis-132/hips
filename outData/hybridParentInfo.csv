Selection was based on half-sib progeny performances with Ia13 double-cross as the tester parent. The designation was changed to BS13(S2)CO because S2 progeny became the basis for evaluation in the next cycle of selection. B84 evolved from one of the 10 S2 lines selected for recombination to give BS13(S2)C1 [BS13(S2)C1 (PI 608782) is registered in Crop Sci. 19:755]. The line has been developed by selection and self-pollination in the ear-to-row system for six generations. The plant has an erect-leaf orientation and will produce a high frequency of harvestable second ears when the plant density is less than 40,000 plants/ha. Pollen production is good, and silks emerge 1 to 2 days after the first shedding of pollen. The date of silk emergence is 1 to 2 days later than that of B73. Most ears have 14 to 16 kernel rows; the seed is yellow with a rounded crown and shallow dent and intermediate in size. Seed yield is good, being slightly higher than that of B73. Inbred B84 has intermediate resistance to leaf feeding by the European corn borer (Ostrinia nubilalis Hubner). Data from single-cross evaluations for 4 years in south-central and southern Iowa show that B84 yields better than B73 in single-cross hybrids, has similar root and stalk strength, but drops fewer ears. Although B84 was developed from the same recurrent selection program as was B73, but two cycles later, the yield performance of the single cross between the two lines indicates that they should not be considered sister lines. Maturity classification is AES800.","Russell, W. A., Iowa State University",NA
