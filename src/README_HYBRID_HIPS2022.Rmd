feet, and the distance between seeds in a row was 6 inches. Nitrogen
application was made on March 29, 2022 at the treatment-specified rates
(Low: 75 lbs/acre, Medium: 150 lbs/acre, High: 225 lbs/acre).
Conventional tillage was done prior to planting.

### Inbred HIPS field

Plots in the Inbred HIPS field were 10 feet long center to center,
including 7.5 feet of plants and 2.5 feet of alley. The planting date
was May 5, 2022. Plots were hand-harvested (4 ears per plot) on October
8, 2022. The previous crop in the field was soybeans. The GPS

## Missouri Valley

175 lbs of urea was applied on both the hybrid and inbred fields in this
location. The nitrogen fertilizer was applied on June 6, 2022. The field
latitude is 41.671747 N and the longitude is -95.943982 W. The fields
were not irrigated. Planting was completed on April 29, 2022 and the
harvest was completed on October 11, 2022.

### Inbred HIPS field

There were 752 plots (376 plots per replication) in this field. The
plots were two-row plots. The plot numbers shown in the image correspond
to those used in the QR codes.

![](images/Missouri%20Valley%20-%20Inbred%20-%20Summary.png)

The plot numbers shown in the image correspond to those included in the
QR codes.

## North Platte

Only the Hybrid HIPS population was grown at this location. Plot numbers
are unique across the North Platte location, but range and row numbers
were duplicated in each field. Each field is a different irrigation
treatment. To account for this, the location was split in 3 by
irrigation treatment in the data. North Platte1 is the full irrigation
field; North Platte2 is the partial irrigation field, and North Platte3
is the dryland, i.e. rainfed, field. The plots were 4-row, 20 foot
plots, with 17 feet of the plot planted and 3 feet of alley. Nitrogen
treatments were blocked within each irrigation treatment. The full
irrigation field was planted on May 17, 2022, and harvested on October
21, 2022 and November 1, 2022 with planted plot lengths of 17.5 feet.
The partial irrigation field was planted on May 17, 2022 and harvested
October 26 - 28, 2022 with planted plot lengths of 17.5 feet. The
dryland field was planted on May 18, 2022 and harvested on October 19-21
and 24, 2022 with planted plot lengths of 17 feet.

In the image above, the blue rectangle is the approximate location of
the full irrigation field, the yellow rectangle is the approximate
location of the partial irrigation field, and the red rectangle is the
approximate location of the dryland field.

The irrigation amounts and timing for the full and partial fields is as
follows:

![](images/Screenshot from 2023-07-25 16-30-18.png)

## Scottsbluff

The field was irrigated for one hour from 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every
Friday evening. The row spacing was 30". In-field measurements
(flowering time, height data, and combine yield measurements) use the
range-row system defined in the sheet 'Layout (Original)' of the files
'Scottsbluff Hybrid HIPS - Summary.xlsx' and 'Scottsbluff Inbred HIPS -
Summary.xlsx'. In the data, these range-row assignments were dropped in
favor of using the range-row assignments listed in the QR codes and used
by the ear phenotype and NIR grain composition measurements, which
better capture the spatial distance between plots where there are border
plots. The geographic location within the field of a plot by its plot
number is the same in both layouts, but the range-row numbering is
different. The range-row system used in the QR codes and the data is
depicted in the sheet 'Layout (Modified)' of the files 'Scottsbluff
Hybrid HIPS - Summary' and 'Scottsbluff Inbred HIPS - Summary.xlsx', and
shown in the image below. 'Fill' is equivalent to 'Border' at other
locations. The field was planted north to south and together, the inbred
and hybrid fields are 625 feet north to south. The fields were planted
on May 19, 2022. A combination of 10-34-0 (NPK) liquid fertilizer and
urea were applied to meet the nitrogen treatment level requirements, as
shown below.

![](images/paste-D4CF04B8.png)

### Inbred HIPS field

The plots were 10 foot (7.5 feet planted), 2-row plots.

![](images/Scottsbluff%20Inbred%20HIPS%20-%20Summary.png)

### Hybrid HIPS field

Based on yield data and grain protein content, it was determined that
the labels in the QR codes for the high and low nitrogen treatments were
reversed. The QR codes in the data reflect the content of the original
QR codes, and the nitrogen treatment variable reflects the actual level
of nitrogen the plot received. The plots were 25 foot (22.5 feet
planted), 4-row plots and the middle two rows were harvested.
