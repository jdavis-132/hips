The paper "Assessing the Impact of Yield Plasticity on Hybrid Performance in Maize" by Davis et al. (2025) used the version of the dataset found at hips/qcData/oldVersions/HIPS_HYBRIDS_2022_AND_2023_V2.3.csv. Spatially corrected data can be found at analysis/HYBRIDS_2022_2023_SPATIALLYCORRECTED.csv. 

The new version of the data adds an additional 2 location years from 2024.
