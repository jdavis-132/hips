Weather Station 2022 Readme



PORTS
•	(Ports A-C meant to be same as G2F)
•	A – soil moisture
•	B – soil temp
•	C – Solar Radiation (range of 300-1100 nanometers)
•	D – PAR (range of 400-700 nanometers)
•	E – UV Radiation (range of 250-400 nanometers)
•	

**Reports, single station export to get the data as the 15 min logging intervals
(Eddy asked that the Curtiss ones have shorter intervals for camera project)



(Reminder: All weather stations were re-certified spring 2021 prior to being deployed)

For 2022, all stations had their modem upgraded for a post cellular 3G world


REPLACEMENT FOR 2023 SEASON:
as of 2/2, this is based on all but NP stations(3)
-2 soil moisture probes
-2 soil temp probe
-wire that connects battery to modem (take pic - Scottsbluff)





***** Note that Lisa flagged *some* data, but there is likely more to look closer at and flag


----

Please note that NORTH PLATTE & SCOTTSBLUFF sites did NOT put the weather station under the irrigation.  They kept a log of how much irrigation was applied & so you MUST look at the irrigation file for the site

- 2022_HIPS_Irrigation_North_Platte
(I copied that data onto a worksheet for the weather station data for the 2 irrigation applied irrigation treatments)



Curtiss Main ie non-irrigated for 2022
(so for 2022, this would be 'non-irrigated' & better suited for Phenobot plot that was not irrigated)
-soil temp probe had damage to the protective cable.  So if data looks off, that would be why



Johnson
-soil probes (temp and moisture) not accurate until after 6pm day of deploy.  Discard any data earlier than 6pm



Marsden
-soil probes (temp and moisture) not accurate until after 6pm day of deploy.  Discard any data earlier than 6pm
-Fall 2022:  the station's rain bucket wouldn't drain. Rain data may not be accurate for this station (ie possible it rained more than it recorded).  Note was added to station to give extra care when we clean rain bucket and re-calibrate in the spring

The station was put away from the gravel road, but that meant it was put closer to the grain bin (which likely was the issue ie loading / unloading grain.)  In the future, we'll have to put the station at the 'back' of the field due to avoiding proximity of the grain bin)


It took an amount of time for the soil moisture probe to change to 100 saturation after we got ~5" of rain in early June
And then something happened at 5:15 am on 6/8 (see dew point humidity, heat index) & then soil moisture wen to 99.9 & stayed at that level





MO Valley:
- when taking station down on 9/24/22, noticed that
	-the soil temp cable was severed outside of the candy cane


Crawfordsville:
-station would not upload to the cloud, so all data was downloaded from the device post season
-when taking station down on 10/2/22, noticed that
	-the time stamp is likely off the whole season. LC saw the hour/minute was correct, but it was listed as 'pm' when I was taking it down in the 'am'
	-the UV data *might* not be accurate.  LC noticed the aux cable was not pushed all the way up

**update 11/2/22 for Crawfordsville:
there was no data on the station, except for when we arrived at Cville to harvest (so no usable data)
I thought the data was being recorded locally on the device, but it seems it never was.
Or I see that the data was at 1 minute intervals.  So it's possible that it just kept overriding itself once the data was 'full'.  When I downloaded it was 8,700 ish entries at 1 min intervals & starting on 9/25/22 ie a few days before we went to Cville.  The interval was left as 'so short' hoping we could jumpstart the uploading to cloud (because it sometimes needs several upload intervals to show up).  We left on the station install date with the interval set so low hoping that it would upload to the cloud and that we'd then correct it to 15 minute intervals.  But since it never uploaded, we never adjusted the interval... and then it just overode the data :(

There **** may **** be a G2F weather station data for Crawfordsville 2022.  When we were there we saw a Watchdog weather station near our field.  Very likely Jode Edwards G2F weather station????
So you can check withe G2F for 2022 weather data & it will be a Watchdog weather station (ie the model that we use).  Do NOT reach out to Dr. Edwards about the data.  Reach out to G2F leads to access the data




Lincoln:
-local team couldn't get the data to upload to the cloud, LC said we could collect off the machine at end of season, but they would need to check on it to make sure it was operating and collecting data.  LC went to NE for personal reasons mid July & found the station was not powered anymore.  She unplugged it to see if the battery just needed recharging, but also told the local team they may need to replace the fuse.  They later plugged the battery back in, but it wouldn't power.  then they replaced the fuse and it did power up.  Jon mentioned that there was another weather station (not Watchdog brand) nearby and he could get that data so that we could have *some* weather data from the area for the field site

update:
-was able to download data from the station
-no data from 5/19 - 6/16 or 7/4 - 7/27
-until 7/28, the UV light was showing data at night


North Platte - Reduced Irrigation
-soil probes are not accurate and not consistent on/after 9/8/22, LC removed data

North Platte - Full Irrigation
-missing data from 7/17 - 10/30.  Will need to see if it is on the station


Scottsbluff:
-the soil moisture and soil temp data look not that reliable for most of the season.  I just left it the way it came from the cloud, but I'd say you wouldn't want to use it
-no cloud data from -- can try to do a manual download to see if data is on the station
~6/17 - 7/2 
7/9 - 7/10

Update to Scottsbluff:  there was no data on the station from the missing dates.  It only had data from September on.  So likely the early season data was overridden?
The soil temp sensor was damaged (clipped in spots).  But the soil moisture sensor looked ok
