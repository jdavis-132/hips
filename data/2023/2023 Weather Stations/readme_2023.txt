Weather Station 2023 Readme



PORTS
•	(Ports A-C meant to be same as G2F)
•	A – soil moisture
•	B – soil temp
•	C – Solar Radiation (range of 300-1100 nanometers)
•	D – PAR (range of 400-700 nanometers)
•	E – UV Radiation (range of 250-400 nanometers)
•	

**Reports, single station export to get the data as the 15 min logging intervals
(Eddy asked that the Curtiss ones have shorter intervals for camera project)



(Reminder: All weather stations were re-certified spring 2021 prior to being deployed)




***** Note that Lisa flagged *some* data, but there is likely more to look closer at and flag

Initially the station listed as North Platte was called as Lincoln & vice versa, but Lisa noticed and corrected this 11/29/23

----

Please note that NORTH PLATTE & SCOTTSBLUFF sites had underground irrigation -- and so the rain from the weather station does NOT take into consideration irrigation applied.  Each site kept a log of how much irrigation was applied & so you MUST look at the irrigation file for the site

(In the past, I was able to get some battery / upload data from the cloud, but as I tried to download on 11/28/23, the cloud system kept 'timing out', so this supplemental data may not be possible)



MO Valley
This station stopped uploading to cloud and so the data was downloaded from the weather station itself.  So there is NOT cumulative rain data on the Excel data file


Crawfordsville
The soil moisture sensor broke / was broke when it was removed from field.  Will need to look at the data to asses accuracy and/or when broke

Scottsbluff 
Water sensor data @ 99.9 whole time - LC needs to try and recalibrate or assess if need to remove the hardware before next year

Marsden
Water sensor data @ 99.9 whole time - LC needs to try and recalibrate or assess if need to remove the hardware before next year



North Platte

Water sensor & soil temp data are not reliable. LC needs to try and recalibrate or assess if need to remove the hardware (sensor or the station itself) before next year
